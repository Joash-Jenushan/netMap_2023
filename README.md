## netMap v2.1.
Introducing netMap v2.1, the result of my initial endeavor to create a tool that encountered technical challenges when executed in Bash. Responding to these issues, I reimagined the tool's functionality using a Python script, refining it to operate seamlessly via the wlan0 interface. netMap v0.5 stands as a testament to perseverance and innovation, now ready to be shared with you all.

"netMap v2.1" is a versatile network scanning tool designed for educational purposes. Developed by Joash-Jenushan, this tool enables users to scan devices within a network IP range using the arp-scan utility. With a focus on simplicity and educational value, netMap v2.1 runs exclusively on the eth0 interface. Its clear-cut interface, adorned with a captivating banner, underscores its ethical intent and educational application. Users can swiftly input the network IP to scan, and netMap v2.1 diligently performs device discovery, showcasing device IP and MAC addresses. A heartfelt disclaimer emphasizes the tool's educational context, while a direct link to the creator's GitHub repository invites further exploration and learning. Engage with netMap v0.5 to deepen your understanding of network dynamics responsibly and ethically.
